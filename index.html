                We provide a <br>comprehensive debt<br> collection service
            </h1>
            <p>Our professionals have a combined 85 years in debt recovery efforts that have seen the recovery of more
                than N19 Billion in debt from very unwilling debtors.</p>
            <p>
                We use the most advanced techniques to trace debtors and recover money owed. We also offer an
                alternative method for loan recoveries by allowing debtors provide value worth the amount they are
                unable to pay.

                    Dealing with debtors can be very stressful for clients, not to mention the time it can take to
                    recover
                    the debt.
                    At Procredita, we help to take the stress away from business owners and allow them to refocus their
                    attention back on what they do best, growing their business.</p>

                <p>Procredita, offers a range of different debt collection services including our “value for cash”
                    service.
                    This means that if debtors are truly unable to pay back, they can provide value for the monies owed,
                    by
                    working for it.</p>

                <p>We work with businesses of all types and sizes, from start-ups through to large corporate companies
                    who
                    operate in a multitude of different industries. Our specialist team are able to adapt to the needs
                    of
                    each client and are skilled in the art of negotiation. We pride ourselves on our professionalism and
                    how
                    we handle our cases. Where possible, we will always attempt to resolve cases through negotiation,
                    however, should you need to pursue the legal option, we can help.
